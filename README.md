Provide an action oriented framework to the CLI (and various other libraries).
==============================================================================

This library parses *action based* command line arguments and invokes the
corresponding code.  Action based means using the first token (after the binary
name) as a mnemonic to invoke some action much like `clone` in `git clone`.

Each action mnemonic is mapped to a function with corresponding arguments
passed at invocation time.

This package has a few other basic utility libraries that is used by this
package but useful for many others (i.e. file system path register and
resolution).

Obtaining
---------
For Clojure, in your `project.clj` file, add:

```clojure
[com.zensols.tools/actioncli "0.0.1"]
```

For Java, in your `pom.xml` file, add:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>clojars</id>
        <url>http://clojars.org/repo/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.zensols.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>actioncli</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Usage
-----

# Resource Location

Many apps (command line) need to find paths on the file system.  This library
provides a way to both register and refine those locations with Java system
properties.

```clojure
(:require '[zensols.actioncli.resource :as res])

(res/register-resource :data :system-file "data" :system-default "../data")
(res/register-resource :runtime-gen :pre-path :data :system-file "db")

(.getPath (res/resource-path :data))
 => ../data

(.getPath (res/resource-path :runtime-gen))
 => ../data/db

(res/set-resource-property-format "myapp.%s")

(System/setProperty "myapp.data" "/new-data-path")

(.getPath (res/resource-path :data))
 => ../new-data-path

(.getPath (res/resource-path :runtime-gen))
 => ../new-data-path/db
```
